# Air2Art  üéØ


## Basic Details

### Project Description
Air2Art lets you draw invisible sketches in mid-air with your finger ‚Äî then instantly turns your airy doodles into stunning AI-generated artworks. It‚Äôs like magic painting, no canvas required!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Why draw on paper or screens when you can just wave your hand and draw in the air? The problem is, there‚Äôs no easy way to turn those air drawings into real art‚Ä¶ yet!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
You draw in the air, and the AI turns your sketch into a real picture‚Äîall using your webcam and some smart code. No mess, no paper, just fun!

The image shows a hand-tracking application called "Air2Art" that uses a skeletal model of a hand to interpret gestures for drawing and generating art.

This image shows a program's console output where an AI model classified a user's sketch as a "boat" and is now using a detailed text prompt to generate a digital painting of a boat.

This image shows the "Air2Art" application interface, displaying a user's simple line drawing of a boat on the left and the detailed, AI-generated digital painting that resulted from it on the right.

The final build of the "Air2Art" application is a gesture-based drawing tool that uses AI to classify a user's simple sketch and then generates a corresponding detailed, high-quality digital painting.

### Project Demo
# Video

The video showcases an "Air2Art" application where a user draws a simple boat in the air with their hand. The software's AI then classifies the drawing and generates a high-quality, realistic digital painting of a boat, presenting the transformation from a basic sketch to a refined piece of art.
