### Project Description
Air2Art lets you draw invisible sketches in mid-air with your finger ‚Äî then instantly turns your airy doodles into stunning AI-generated artworks. It‚Äôs like magic painting, no canvas required!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Why draw on paper or screens when you can just wave your hand and draw in the air? The problem is, there‚Äôs no easy way to turn those air drawings into real art‚Ä¶ yet!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
You draw in the air, and the AI turns your sketch into a real picture‚Äîall using your webcam and some smart code. No mess, no paper, just fun!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
